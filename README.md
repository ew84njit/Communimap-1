# Communimap
Communimap is a web application project where users can post events on to a public-view map powered by the Google Maps API. 

What you can do:
* Enter information about upcoming events
* View other events happening on the map

The site has not launched yet, but when it does you can try out the web app for yourself [HERE](http://communimap.com) or just type in http://communimap.com. 

**NOTE:** there are still some changes to be made. This is a work in progress demo.
