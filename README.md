# Communimap
Communimap is a web application project where users can post events on to a public-view map powered by the Google Maps API. 

What you can do:
* Enter information about upcoming events
* View other events going on on the map

The site has not launched yet, but when it does you can try out the web app for yourself [here](http://communimap.com)
