# Communimap
Communimap is a web application project where users can post events on to a public-view map powered by the Google Maps API. 

**What you can do:**
* Enter information about upcoming events
* View other events happening on the map

If the site is up and running, you can try out the web app for yourself [HERE](http://communimap.com) or just type in the browser http://communimap.com. 

***NOTE:*** There are still some changes to be made. This is a work in progress demo. 

**Pending Updates:**
* Delete marker button will be added soon
* Edit event function will be added soon
